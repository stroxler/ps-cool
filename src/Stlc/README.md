# Simply Typed Lambda Calculus

To get started in purescript, I decided to follow along with the
"Type Theory in Purescript" videos on Youtube:

In particular I want to learn the parser combinator library in order to
be able to use purescript for a toy compiler.

This directory will probably contain more or less exactly what they develop
in the videos.
